# packageManifest - What is it?
<b>Design Usage:</b><br>
For use with Hubitat Package Manager

- Each app/driver will have a packageManifest.json which tells the Hubitat Package Manager all about the app.  Specifically when there are updates!
- There is no need for you to do anything with this file.
