# BPTWorld Apps and Data Collection

<hr>
My apps do NOT collect any data of any kind from any users. 
<br><br>
Each app does reach out to GitHub to retrieve the Header and Footer messages. This is just a simple json file located in the main directory. This file is openly available to anyone who would want to see what's in it. Simply click on it to view its contents.
<br><br>
I do not collect any IP addresses, download statistics, app usage or any other information - I ca not tell you how many people use or download any of my apps/drivers or even access the json file. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
<br><br>
<b>Remember - Your data is your data and what you do with it is your business and nobody else's.</b>
